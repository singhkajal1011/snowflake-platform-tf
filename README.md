# Snowflake DataOps Platform — Terraform + DCM (Repo 1 of 3)

A fully automated Snowflake DataOps platform managed through **Terraform** (account/platform
layer, folder: `terraform/`) and **Snowflake DCM** (database object layer, folder: `dcm/`),
with CI/CD via GitHub Actions and Terraform remote state in AWS S3. This is Repo 1
(`snowflake-platform-tf`) of a 3-repo client demo — Repo 2: `data-ingestion-raw` (Snowpipe
ingestion into RAW); Repo 3: `customer-domain-dbt` (dbt transformations for the Customer
domain). **This repo is the sole provisioner of resources for all 3 repos** — Repos 2 and 3
contain only code (SQL / dbt models) that runs against identities and objects this repo
creates; see [How Repo 1 Feeds Repos 2 & 3](#how-repo-1-feeds-repos-2--3) below.

## Architecture Overview

This repo is **Repo 1 of a 3-repo platform**, pairing Terraform with Snowflake's native DCM
(Database Change Management):

- **Terraform** (`terraform/`) owns the account/platform layer for the whole 3-repo
  platform, not just this repo: GitHub OIDC service identities for all 4 engines
  (`GITHUB_DEV_TERRAFORM_SVC`, `GITHUB_DEV_DCM_SVC`, `GITHUB_DEV_DBT_SVC` for Repo 3,
  `GITHUB_DEV_INGEST_SVC` for Repo 2), plus the AWS infrastructure Repo 2's ingestion
  pipeline runs against (S3 bucket + 2 IAM roles — `terraform/ingestion_aws_infra.tf`).
  Repo 2 itself contains ingestion **code** only, no infrastructure.
- **DCM** (`dcm/`) owns the database object layer: databases, schemas, warehouses, tiered
  RBAC roles, DB grants, and placeholder masking/row-access policies
  (`dcm/sources/definitions/*.sql`).

Identities are scoped to **GitHub Environments** (`DEV-Terraform`, `DEV-DCM`, and each
downstream repo's own environment — `DEV-Ingest` in Repo 2, `DEV-dbt` in Repo 3), not to a
branch or event — see the OIDC rationale comment at the top of
`terraform/oidc_service_user.tf`. This decouples environment from branch so a future
trunk-based TEST/UAT/PROD promotion flow doesn't require re-architecting the identity model.

## Folder Structure

This repo is split into exactly 2 top-level folders by *which engine owns the resource* —
`terraform/` for everything Terraform provisions, `dcm/` for everything DCM provisions.
Nothing Terraform-related lives outside `terraform/`; nothing DCM-related lives outside
`dcm/`.

**Quick way to tell the 3 Terraform roots apart**: `terraform/bootstrap/state-backend/` and
`terraform/bootstrap/oidc-identity/` are each applied **once, by hand**, with local state,
and never run by CI. Everything else in `terraform/` is the **ongoing** root module —
remote (S3) state, deployed automatically by CI on every merge to `main`.

## How Repo 1 Feeds Repos 2 & 3

Repo 1 is the **only** repo of the 3 that provisions resources. Repos 2 and 3 never create
their own Snowflake users, roles, warehouses, or AWS infrastructure — they authenticate as
an identity Repo 1 already created, scoped to exactly the role Repo 1 granted, and run only
application-level code (SQL / dbt models) against objects Repo 1 already defined. If Repo 1
hasn't run yet, Repo 2/3's pipelines fail cleanly (user or role doesn't exist) rather than
silently drifting.

| What Repo 1 provisions (via `terraform/` + `dcm/`) | Consumed by |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_DEV_INGEST_SVC` identity + `DEV_CUSTOMER_INGEST_SERVICE_PRSN` role | Repo 2 (`data-ingestion-raw`) authenticates as this identity to deploy/run its Snowpipe SQL |
| `GITHUB_DEV_DBT_SVC` identity + `DEV_CUSTOMER_DBT_SERVICE_PRSN` role | Repo 3 (`customer-domain-dbt`) authenticates as this identity to run `dbt build` |
| `DEV_CUSTOMER_DB.RAW` schema + its `CREATE TABLE`/`CREATE STAGE`/`CREATE FILE FORMAT`/`CREATE PIPE` grants (`dcm/sources/definitions/schemas.sql`, `grants.sql`) | Repo 3 creates `RAW.CUSTOMERS` itself (`macros/create_raw_tables.sql`); Repo 2 loads into it; Repo 3 also reads it as a dbt source |
| `DEV_CUSTOMER_DB.STAGING` / `.MARTS` schemas, `DEV_CUSTOMER_TRANSFORM_WH` warehouse | Repo 3 builds its dbt models into these |
| S3 bucket `data-ingestion-raw-525218385225` + 2 IAM roles (`terraform/ingestion_aws_infra.tf`) | Repo 2's CI assumes one role to manage the bucket; Snowflake's storage integration assumes the other to read it |
| `.github/workflows/dbt-build-reusable.yml` (`workflow_call`) | Every per-domain dbt repo (Repo 3 and its future siblings) calls this instead of defining its own dbt build logic — see "Centrally-maintained CI for Repo 3" below |

**What Repo 2/3 developers can do independently** (no Repo 1 PR needed): add a new
pipe/stage reading from the same bucket into the same existing table (Repo 2); add a new
dbt model reading existing sources into the existing `STAGING`/`MARTS` schemas, or a new
RAW table (via a new `on-run-start` macro, same pattern as `create_raw_tables.sql`) (Repo 3).

**What requires a Repo 1 PR first**: a new RAW *schema* (not table — tables are Repo 3's
responsibility, schemas are Repo 1's), a new AWS bucket or broader privileges, a new
domain database, or standing up a brand-new downstream repo for a new domain team —
anything that doesn't exist yet in Repo 1's
Terraform/DCM definitions.

### Centrally-maintained CI for Repo 3

Repo 3 is **one GitHub repo per domain** — `customer-domain-dbt` today, a future
`procurement-domain-dbt` or similar later. Rather than each domain repo hand-maintaining
its own full copy of the dbt build pipeline (checkout, install dbt-snowflake, fetch an
OIDC token, configure `profiles.yml`, run `dbt build`, post a PR comment, clean up ephemeral
PR schemas), every domain repo's `.github/workflows/dbt-ci.yml` is a **thin wrapper** that
calls `.github/workflows/dbt-build-reusable.yml` in *this* repo:

```yaml
jobs:
  dbt:
    uses: radhasgrl/snowflake-platform-tf/.github/workflows/dbt-build-reusable.yml@main
    with:
      domain: customer
      dbt_project_name: customer_domain
      account: xygpmhm-gq04150
      user: GITHUB_DEV_DBT_SVC
      role: DEV_CUSTOMER_DBT_SERVICE_PRSN
      warehouse: DEV_CUSTOMER_TRANSFORM_WH
      database: DEV_CUSTOMER_DB
      schema: STAGING
      github_environment: DEV-dbt
```

Fixing a bug or adding a step to the dbt build process means editing
`dbt-build-reusable.yml` **once, here** — every domain repo referencing `@main` picks up
the change on its next run, with no PR needed in each individual domain repo. A domain
repo's own `dbt-ci.yml` only ever needs to change its own `with:` values (e.g. a new
domain's database/warehouse/role names), never the build logic itself.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version used | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Terraform | 1.16.0 | Pinned via `terraform/.terraform-version` |
| Snowflake CLI (`snow`) | 3.25.0 | Used by DCM's `snow dcm` commands in CI |
| AWS CLI | 2.36.33 | Only needed for the one-time bootstrap steps below |
| GitHub CLI (`gh`) | 2.98.0 | Convenience for managing the repo/PRs |
| Git | 2.55.0 | |

No Terraform/Snowflake credentials need to be installed or configured locally for day-to-day
work — the CI/CD pipeline authenticates entirely via GitHub OIDC (see below). Local
Terraform commands against the repo-root module will not work outside real GitHub Actions
runtime, because the Snowflake provider's `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY` authenticator requires a
genuine GitHub Actions-issued OIDC token (see [Verification Guide](#verification-guide)).

---

## One-Time Bootstrap (run once, by hand)

Two small, independent Terraform root modules exist solely to solve a chicken-and-egg
problem: the ongoing, CI-managed root module needs an S3 backend and a CI identity to
exist before it can run — and neither of those can create themselves. Both are applied
**once, manually, with local state**, and are never touched by CI afterward.

### 1. `terraform/bootstrap/state-backend/` — creates the S3 bucket for Terraform's own remote state

```powershell
cd terraform/bootstrap/state-backend
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Creates the S3 bucket (`snowflake-platform-tf-state-525218385225`, versioned, AES256-encrypted,
public access blocked) that the repo-root module's backend (`terraform/env/dev/backend.hcl`) points at.

### 2. `terraform/bootstrap/oidc-identity/` — creates the GitHub OIDC trust + CI IAM role

```powershell
cd terraform/bootstrap/oidc-identity
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Creates the GitHub OIDC provider (one per AWS account) and the IAM role
(`snowflake-platform-tf-github-oidc`) that CI assumes via `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` — no
stored AWS access keys anywhere. Deliberately run by a human, not by CI, since CI can't
bootstrap its own permissions using the permissions it doesn't have yet.

### 3. Repo-root module (`terraform/`) — first apply, from CI

Once both bootstrap stacks exist, the repo-root module (`terraform/`, minus `bootstrap/`) is
initialized and applied **by CI**, not locally:

```powershell
# from terraform/ — only works inside real GitHub Actions (see Prerequisites above)
terraform init -backend-config="env/dev/backend.hcl"
```

Its first successful `terraform apply` creates the GitHub OIDC service users
(`GITHUB_DEV_TERRAFORM_SVC`, `GITHUB_DEV_DCM_SVC` in `terraform/oidc_service_user.tf`;
`GITHUB_DEV_DBT_SVC`, `GITHUB_DEV_INGEST_SVC` via `modules/domain_onboarding/`, configured
in `terraform/domains/dev/customer.yaml`) that every subsequent CI run, and Repos 2/3's
pipelines, authenticate as.

### Mandatory notes
- Both bootstrap stacks' local state files (`terraform/bootstrap/*/terraform.tfstate`) are
  **not** pushed to git (covered by `.gitignore`) — they're the only authoritative record of
  what's been applied, so never delete them without first confirming nothing live depends
  on them.
- The S3 state bucket region is `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney), matching the client's AWS region.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline (ongoing, automated)

Authentication for **every** ongoing pipeline run — Terraform, DCM, and both downstream
repos — is GitHub OIDC workload identity. There are no stored Snowflake credentials
(no RSA keys, no passwords) and no stored long-lived AWS access keys anywhere in this
repo's CI: AWS access is via the OIDC IAM role created above; Snowflake access is via each
service user's `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY` auth, with the OIDC token fetched fresh inside each job.

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/terraform-plan.yml` | Pull Request touching `terraform/**` **or** `dcm/**`, or manual dispatch | PR plans always use DEV; manual runs can select DEV or TEST. Runs `terraform fmt -check` + `validate` + `plan` (PR plan posted as a comment) |
| `.github/workflows/terraform-apply.yml` | Push to `main` touching `terraform/**` **or** `dcm/**` | `Terraform Apply` |
| `.github/workflows/dcm-plan.yml` | `workflow_run` — fires once Terraform Plan finishes | `DCM Plan` (one sequential job, all changed domains) |
| `.github/workflows/dcm-deploy.yml` | `workflow_run` — fires once Terraform Apply finishes | `DCM Deploy` (one sequential job, all changed domains) |

**Terraform always runs first, DCM always runs second, one after another — by design,
per explicit requirement.** The two tools still live in separate files (CI load,
PR-check naming, and CODEOWNERS routing stay scoped per-tool), but execution is
sequenced: DCM is triggered by Terraform's own workflow *finishing*, not by the
PR/push event directly. DCM's identity (`GITHUB_DEV_DCM_SVC`) is created by Terraform,
so DCM must never run without a guaranteed-successful Terraform run immediately
before it — this is why both Terraform workflows' path filters include `dcm/**` too: a
DCM-only change still needs Terraform to run first, so DCM has something to chain from.

Terraform plans triggered by a pull request always use the DEV account identity and
state. A manually dispatched Terraform Plan can target DEV or TEST; TEST runs use the
protected `TEST-Terraform` GitHub Environment. PROD is intentionally not offered until
its Terraform state, Snowflake OIDC identity, and protection environment are configured.

```

A domain only ever gets planned/deployed if (a) its own `dcm/domains/<domain>/` files
changed, or (b) the shared `dcm/sources/` changed (which affects every domain), AND
(c) it's listed in `dcm/active_domains.json`. This keeps CI load flat as domains scale
into the hundreds — a PR touching one domain's manifest never replans every other
domain too. Each active domain is still planned/deployed independently inside one
sequential loop (not a parallel matrix — see below for why), so one domain's failure
doesn't stop the others from being attempted or reported.

Each workflow runs under its own GitHub Environment (`DEV-Terraform` or `DEV-DCM`) —
visible under **Settings → Environments** in the GitHub UI, each scoped to its own OIDC
service-user subject claim.

### Why DCM is sequenced via `workflow_run`, and why there's no per-domain matrix anymore

Two real GitHub Actions limitations shaped this design, both confirmed directly against
GitHub's own documentation rather than assumed:

1. **A `workflow_run`-triggered workflow's results don't automatically attach to the
   originating PR**, and can't satisfy a required branch-protection status check — only
   `push`/`pull_request`/`pull_request_review`/`pull_request_target`/`deployment(_status)`
   -triggered workflows can. Chaining `dcm-plan.yml` off `terraform-plan.yml` finishing
   (the only way to guarantee real sequencing across two separate files) would otherwise
   mean `DCM Plan`'s result silently never reaches the PR, leaving the required check
   stuck as "Expected — Waiting for status to be reported" forever. Fixed by having
   `dcm-plan.yml` manually create and update its own check run via the Checks API
   (`github.rest.checks.create`/`update`), tied to the PR's exact commit SHA — the
   standard, documented pattern for this exact problem, not a workaround invented here.
2. **A matrix job's dynamically-generated name can never be a required status check** —
   GitHub can't express "require whichever of `DCM Plan (customer)`, `DCM Plan
   (procurement)`, ... happened to run this time." The former `DCM Plan (gate)` job
   existed purely to translate a matrix's dynamic results into one fixed, requireable
   name. Replacing the per-domain matrix with one sequential job (looping through
   however many domains need replanning/redeploying) removes the need for that
   fan-in job entirely — the one job's own fixed name (`DCM Plan`) can be required
   directly. The trade-off: domains are planned/deployed one after another instead of
   in parallel, acceptable at this scale and simpler than maintaining both the matrix
   and a workaround for its naming problem.

### Why Terraform and DCM are still separate files

- **Misleading naming**: a file named `terraform-plan.yml` containing jobs called
  `DCM Plan (customer)` is confusing on its own.
- **CODEOWNERS can still route by concern** — `/terraform/` and `/dcm/` are owned by
  different teams at the source level; the workflow files match that even though
  execution is now sequenced between them.
- **Blast radius**: a typo in one tool's job definition can't directly corrupt the
  other's YAML, even though they now run in a guaranteed order.

**The identity-ordering wrinkle, resolved**: DCM authenticates as `GITHUB_DEV_DCM_SVC`, an
identity *Terraform itself creates*. This is exactly why DCM is chained off Terraform via
`workflow_run` rather than running independently — DCM genuinely cannot run correctly
without a prior successful Terraform run, so the two are now guaranteed to execute in that
order, every time, rather than merely checked for and failed fast on. (An earlier version
of this pipeline ran Terraform and DCM as fully independent pipelines with a same-job
"Verify DCM identity is ready" fail-fast check instead of real sequencing — this was
revisited and replaced with the `workflow_run` chaining described above, per explicit
requirement that the two tools run one after another.)

### Mandatory notes
- `workflow_dispatch:` is enabled on all 4 workflows for manual triggering without needing a
  PR or push.
- This is deliberately **DEV-only** for the continuous pipeline above — see
  [Environments & Versioning](#environments--versioning) for how TEST is promoted to, and
  [Known Limitations](#known-limitations-demo-scope) for what's still DEV-only.

## Environments & Versioning

How "what version is running where" is actually answered, end to end — DEV deploys
continuously on every merge; TEST (and, in future, PROD) is promoted deliberately, by
version, with a human approval gate.

### Environment Details

| Environment | How it's reached | Snowflake objects (Customer domain) | GitHub Environment | Approval gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEV | Automatic — every merge to `main` | `DEV_CUSTOMER_DB`, `DEV_CUSTOMER_*_WH`, `DEV_CUSTOMER_*_PRSN` | `DEV-Terraform` / `DEV-DCM` | None (continuous) |
| TEST | Manual — `promote.yml` dispatched against a specific release tag (Terraform, then DCM) | `TEST_CUSTOMER_DB`, `TEST_CUSTOMER_*_WH`, `TEST_CUSTOMER_*_PRSN` | `TEST-Terraform` / `TEST-DCM` | Required reviewer, non-bypassable even by an admin |
| PROD | Not built yet | — | — | — |

Unlike a branch-per-environment model (one long-lived branch per environment, promotion =
merging one branch into the next), this repo uses **trunk-based development with
version-tag promotion**: a single `main` branch, squash-merged, deploying continuously to
DEV; TEST (and future PROD) are promoted by picking a specific, already-tagged release —
never "whatever is currently on `main`." This was a deliberate choice, not an oversight:
it gives an exact, auditable answer to "what's in TEST right now" (a specific tag,
promoted on a specific date, by a specific approver) that a branch-per-environment model
can't express as cleanly (there, "what's in TEST" is just "whatever was last merged into
the `test` branch," with no separate version identifier).

                                                        Deployed to TEST
```

- **PR titles must follow Conventional Commits** (`pr-title-lint.yml`, enforced as a
  required check) — because this repo squash-merges, the PR title becomes the commit
  message on `main`, which is the only thing `release-please` reads to compute version
  bumps (`fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, `feat!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE:` → major).
- **`release-please.yml`** maintains one standing Release PR, updated on every push to
  `main`, never auto-tagging by itself — merging that PR is the deliberate "cut a
  release" decision that creates the real tag + GitHub Release.
- **`promote.yml`** is `workflow_dispatch`-only (never automatic) and always checks out
  the exact tagged commit, not whatever `main` currently is — so later merges can't
  silently change what gets deployed to TEST. **Terraform is promoted by the same tag as
  DCM**, not just DCM: every platform resource (`oidc_service_user.tf`, `dcm_home.tf`,
  `domain_identities.tf`/`domain_identities_test.tf`) is gated with
  `count = local.env == "<TIER>" ? 1 : 0`, so the identical root module, applied against
  `env/test/` and its own state file (`workload/test/terraform.tfstate`), manages only
  TEST-tier resources — the same one-codebase-many-environments pattern HashiCorp
  documents for multi-environment Terraform
  ([Recommended Practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/recommended-practices)).
  The shared ingestion AWS infra (`ingestion_aws_infra.tf`: one S3 bucket, one set of IAM
  roles) stays DEV-pipeline-owned only — there's one AWS account for this whole platform,
  nothing environment-specific to promote there.
- Repo 2 (`data-ingestion-raw`) and Repo 3 (`customer-domain-dbt`) use the identical
  pattern (`pr-title-lint.yml`, `release-please.yml`, `promote.yml`), each with their own
  `TEST-Ingest`/`TEST-dbt` GitHub Environment and required-reviewer gate. Repo 3's
  `promote.yml` has one structural difference: its actual build logic lives in this
  repo's `dbt-build-reusable.yml` (`workflow_call`), and a job that calls a reusable
  workflow can't also run its own `checkout` step — so promoting a specific version there
  means dispatching `promote.yml` **against that tag as the git ref**
  (`gh workflow run promote.yml --ref v1.1.0 ...`), not as a workflow input.

### Known limitation: single Snowflake account, naming-prefix isolation

DEV and TEST are isolated by naming convention (`DEV_CUSTOMER_DB` vs. `TEST_CUSTOMER_DB`)
within **one** Snowflake account, not by separate accounts. This is a real, disclosed
trade-off, not an oversight — some reference client infrastructure (e.g. AWS-account-per-
environment models) isolates environments at the account/subscription level instead,
which is a stronger blast-radius boundary (a credential or policy mistake in one
environment's account literally cannot reach another environment's resources) at the cost
of more accounts to provision, more cross-account identity federation, and higher ongoing
admin overhead. For a demo and for many real platforms, naming-prefix isolation within one
account is a reasonable, lower-cost choice — but it's a genuine trade-off a client should
make deliberately, not something this repo silently decided for them. Moving to separate
accounts per environment would not require redesigning the promotion model above — it
would mean new per-environment Terraform/DCM identities and connection targets, the same
pattern already used for TEST, repeated per account.

---

## Destroying / Decommissioning Resources

**Deliberately not part of CI/CD.** An earlier version of this repo had a guarded,
manual-trigger `destroy.yml` GitHub Actions workflow — removed after reconsidering the
trade-off: a typed-confirmation guard only stops *accidental* triggers, not a malicious or
careless *intentional* one, and anyone who can hit `workflow_dispatch` could already type
the confirmation phrase on purpose. Putting a destroy path in the same CI/CD trust boundary
that deploys the platform means any future CI compromise (leaked token, malicious PR from a
fork, compromised collaborator account) could reach destroy too, not just deploy. This
matches the infra-platform reference's own restraint: it only ever automates
`snow dcm purge` against its disposable sandbox tier — never against its real, persistent
environments. Our `DEV` is the only environment this whole demo runs on, so it gets the
same restraint.

Destroying is a human-operated, local-only runbook instead — authenticated as yourself
(MFA-gated `externalbrowser`/admin login), not via a CI service identity.

**Destroy in this order** if tearing down multiple layers: DCM domain(s) first, then
Terraform **last** — Terraform owns the identities every other layer (and Repos 2/3)
authenticate as, so destroying it first strands everything else mid-teardown.

### 1. One domain's DCM objects

```powershell
snow connection add --connection-name manual_admin --account xygpmhm-gq04150 `
  --user <your-username> --role SYSADMIN --authenticator externalbrowser --no-interactive
cd dcm
bash sync-domain.sh customer   # synthesize the domain's sources/ (purge needs them resolvable)
snow dcm purge --target CUSTOMER --from domains/customer --force -c manual_admin
```

Drops that domain's database, schemas, warehouses, and roles — **not** the DCM project
object itself, which stays behind empty and can be redeployed into later.

(There is no account-level DCM project to destroy anymore — see "History" below for why
the `dcm/account/` project that used to live here was removed entirely.)

### 2. Terraform (last, and the one genuine technical wrinkle)

`terraform/providers.tf` hardcodes `authenticator = "WORKLOAD_IDENTITY"` on every Snowflake
provider block — which, per the "Local Terraform verification" note above, **only works
inside real GitHub Actions**. Running `terraform destroy` locally therefore needs a local,
human-authenticated override of those two providers first. Terraform has a native mechanism
for exactly this — a `*_override.tf` file, already covered by `.gitignore`, so it can never
accidentally be committed:

```hcl
# terraform/local_admin_override.tf — LOCAL ONLY, gitignored, never commit. Overrides
# useradmin/sysadmin to use your own MFA-authenticated login instead of WORKLOAD_IDENTITY
# (CI-only), so `terraform destroy` can run as a human, locally.
provider "snowflake" {
  alias             = "useradmin"
  organization_name = "xygpmhm"
  account_name      = "gq04150"
  user              = "<your-username>"
  role              = "USERADMIN"
  authenticator     = "externalbrowser"
}

provider "snowflake" {
  alias             = "sysadmin"
  organization_name = "xygpmhm"
  account_name      = "gq04150"
  user              = "<your-username>"
  role              = "SYSADMIN"
  authenticator     = "externalbrowser"
}
```

Then, with valid local AWS credentials (for the S3 backend) and this override file in place:

```powershell
cd terraform
terraform init -backend-config="env/dev/backend.hcl"
terraform destroy -var-file="env/dev/dev.tfvars"
# review the plan carefully, then type 'yes' when prompted
```

Destroys the 4 OIDC identities, `DEV_ADMIN_DB`, and Repo 2's S3 bucket + IAM roles. Delete
`terraform/local_admin_override.tf` again once done (or just leave it — it's gitignored and
inert until the next local Terraform run).

---

## History — Terraform → DCM Cutover, then Domain Templating

Databases, schemas, warehouses, functional roles, and DB grants were originally defined as
Terraform resources. They were migrated to DCM, using `removed` blocks (previously
`terraform/removed.tf`, deleted once the cutover was confirmed safe — see commit history
for the original file) so Terraform forgot them without destroying the live Snowflake
objects — DCM adopted the exact same objects with no disruption. Names were also changed
from generic to Customer-domain-scoped at the same time:

| Old (Terraform, generic) | Current (DCM, Customer-domain) |
|---|---|
| `DEV_LANDING_DB` / `DEV_ANALYTICS_DB` / `DEV_COMMON_DB` | `DEV_CUSTOMER_DB` (single domain database) |
| `DEV_LANDING_DB.RAW` | `DEV_CUSTOMER_DB.RAW` |
| `DEV_ANALYTICS_DB.STAGING` | `DEV_CUSTOMER_DB.STAGING` |
| `DEV_ANALYTICS_DB.MARTS` | `DEV_CUSTOMER_DB.MARTS` |
| `DEV_COMMON_DB.UTILS` | `DEV_CUSTOMER_DB.SHARED` |
| `DEV_DATA_ENGINEER` / `_ANALYST` / `_CONSUMER` / `DEV_DBT_RUNNER` | Tiered: `DEV_CUSTOMER_*_PRSN` → `DEV_CUSTOMER_*_FNCRL` → `DEV_CUSTOMER_DB.*_SCRL_*` / `DEV_CUSTOMER_*_WH_WHRL_*` |

DCM's hand-written SQL was later rewritten into a reusable, Jinja2-templated structure
(`dcm/sources/`) so a new domain needs zero new SQL — only a new
`dcm/domains/<domain>/manifest.yml`. As part of that work, warehouses were also renamed from
generic/shared (`DEV_INGEST_WH`/`DEV_TRANSFORM_WH`/`DEV_REPORTING_WH`) to per-domain
(`DEV_CUSTOMER_INGEST_WH`/`DEV_CUSTOMER_TRANSFORM_WH`/`DEV_CUSTOMER_REPORTING_WH`) —
matching the reference architecture's convention that domain workload warehouses are never
shared across domains (only genuine platform/CI tooling warehouses would be, and this
platform doesn't currently have any). The current, live definitions for all of the above are
`dcm/sources/definitions/databases.sql`, `schemas.sql`, `warehouses.sql`,
`roles.sql`, `database_roles.sql`, and `grants.sql`, with the actual per-domain values in
`dcm/domains/customer/manifest.yml` — treat those files, not this table, as the source of
truth going forward.

A separate, account-level DCM project (`dcm/account/`) was also introduced for a while, to
hold one genuinely platform-wide, hand-written (non-templated) object — `DEV_DEPLOY_WH`, a
CI/tooling warehouse, matching the infra-platform reference's own account-level
`dcm/manifest.yml` convention. It was removed after confirming (via grep across every
workflow) that nothing ever actually referenced it: every Terraform/DCM CI connection runs
with no explicit `--warehouse` at all, since those tools' operations are metadata/DDL only
and don't require active compute. Rather than leave an unused, undocumented resource in the
platform ahead of a client demo, it was decommissioned in two steps — first dropped
declaratively via a normal `snow dcm plan`/`deploy` (removing its SQL definition so DCM
planned and applied the `DROP WAREHOUSE` itself), then the now-empty DCM project object was
purged by hand (`snow dcm purge --target ACCOUNT --from account`, human-authenticated, the
same local-only pattern as "Destroying / Decommissioning Resources" above) before deleting
`dcm/account/` and its `account-plan`/`account-deploy` CI jobs from the repo entirely. The
account-level pattern itself is still sound (and matches the reference) — it simply isn't
needed again until a genuine platform-wide object actually exists to put there.

## Onboarding a New Domain

This is the actual, repeatable procedure for adding domain #2 (and #3...#200) — not a
hypothetical. `dcm/domains/procurement/manifest.yml` exists in this repo right now as a
**worked example**, built and validated exactly this way, but deliberately **not deployed**
(see "Known Limitations" below for why).

1. **Write `dcm/domains/<domain>/manifest.yml`.** Copy an existing domain's manifest, change
   `domain`, `domain_comment`, and the `schemas`/`warehouses`/`personas`/`functional_roles`
   values to match the new domain. Give it its **own new `project_name`**
   (e.g. `DEV_ADMIN_DB.DCM.PROCUREMENT_DCM`) — brand-new domains always get a fresh DCM
   project; only Customer stayed on the pre-templating project for migration-safety
   reasons (see History above). No SQL is written by hand anywhere in this step.

2. **Validate it renders cleanly, offline, before touching Snowflake.**
   ```powershell
   cd dcm
   python _validate_render.py domains/<domain>/manifest.yml <CONFIG_NAME>
   ```
   This runs the same Jinja2 macros DCM itself uses, in `StrictUndefined` mode, against
   every file in `sources/definitions/` — it catches the exact class of bug this project
   hit once for real (an optional manifest key missing a `| default(...)` guard) without
   ever creating or touching a live Snowflake object.

3. **Add one new file, `terraform/domains/dev/<domain>.yaml`** (copy
   `domains/dev/procurement.yaml.example`, drop the `.example` extension, fill in the
   placeholders) — `GITHUB_DEV_<DOMAIN>_DBT_SVC` (scoped to that domain's own dbt repo) and
   `GITHUB_DEV_<DOMAIN>_INGEST_SVC` (scoped to a new GitHub Environment in the shared
   ingestion repo, e.g. `DEV-Ingest-<Domain>`) — referenced by the manifest's
   `DBT_SERVICE`/`INGEST_SERVICE` persona `oidc_user` fields from step 1. Nothing in
   `terraform/modules/domain_onboarding/`, `domain_identities.tf`, or any other domain's
   file ever needs to change — `domain_identities.tf` merges every `*.yaml` file under
   `domains/dev/` automatically.

4. **Add one new entry to `dcm/active_domains.json`** — `{"name": "<domain>", "target":
   "<DOMAIN>"}`. This is the single switch that turns the domain "on" for CI: the
   `detect-domains` job in both workflows diffs changed files against this list and only
   creates a `dcm-plan`/`dcm-deploy` job (dynamic matrix, not a hand-copied job block) for
   domains that are both listed here *and* actually changed. A domain's manifest.yml can
   exist and be fully valid (like Procurement's) without ever running in CI — adding it to
   this file is the explicit, auditable "go live" step.

5. **Merge.** CI creates the new DCM project (`snow dcm create --if-not-exists`) and
   deploys it — same mechanism already verified live for Customer and for the Option B
   warehouse rename.

### Known Limitations (this section specifically)

`dcm/domains/procurement/manifest.yml` is intentionally a **template only** — steps 3 and 4
above have *not* been done for it, so it creates nothing in Snowflake. This is a deliberate
demo choice: proving the pattern generalizes (step 1-2, done and verified) without carrying
a second set of live identities/objects/repos that would need ongoing upkeep before this is
actually needed for a real client domain.

### On AWS

```powershell
# Verify S3 bucket exists in Sydney
aws s3api head-bucket --bucket snowflake-platform-tf-state-525218385225 --region ap-southeast-2

# Verify versioning is enabled
aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket snowflake-platform-tf-state-525218385225 --region ap-southeast-2
# Expected: { "Status": "Enabled" }

# Verify state file is present
aws s3 ls s3://snowflake-platform-tf-state-525218385225/workload/dev/ --region ap-southeast-2
# Expected: terraform.tfstate

# Verify encryption
aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket snowflake-platform-tf-state-525218385225 --region ap-southeast-2
# Expected: AES256

# Verify no public access
aws s3api get-public-access-block --bucket snowflake-platform-tf-state-525218385225 --region ap-southeast-2
# Expected: all four values = true
```

### On GitHub

```powershell
# Verify only the one actually-used secret exists (AWS_REGION) — no stored Snowflake
# credentials or static AWS access keys should be present
gh secret list --repo radhasgrl/snowflake-platform-tf
# Expected: AWS_REGION only

# Verify both environments exist, each with its own OIDC-scoped identity
gh api repos/radhasgrl/snowflake-platform-tf/environments --jq '.environments[].name'
# Expected: DEV-Terraform, DEV-DCM

# Verify latest pipeline runs all passed
gh run list --repo radhasgrl/snowflake-platform-tf --limit 5
# Expected: all rows show success

# Manually trigger a plan run (no PR needed)
gh workflow run terraform-plan.yml --repo radhasgrl/snowflake-platform-tf
gh workflow run dcm-plan.yml --repo radhasgrl/snowflake-platform-tf
gh run list --repo radhasgrl/snowflake-platform-tf --limit 3
```

### Local Terraform verification — important limitation

`terraform plan`/`apply`/`import` against the **repo-root module** (`terraform/`, minus
`bootstrap/`) cannot be run locally — the Snowflake provider's `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY`
authenticator requires a genuine GitHub Actions-issued OIDC token (fetched via
`ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN`), which only exists inside real GitHub Actions runtime.
This blocks *every* command against that module, not just ones touching Snowflake
resources, since Terraform configures all declared providers before running any operation.
To verify the root module, use `workflow_dispatch` to run
`terraform-plan.yml`/`terraform-apply.yml`/`dcm-plan.yml`/`dcm-deploy.yml` for real, or
read the PR comment a real CI run posts. The two `terraform/bootstrap/` stacks are the
exception — they only use the AWS provider, so `terraform plan` against them works locally
with valid AWS credentials.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| IaC tool | Terraform 1.16.0 | Client requirement; not OpenTofu |
| Snowflake auth | GitHub OIDC workload identity (`WORKLOAD_IDENTITY` authenticator) | No stored keys or passwords anywhere — short-lived tokens fetched fresh per CI run |
| AWS auth | GitHub OIDC (`AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`) | Same reasoning — no stored AWS access keys in CI |
| State storage | AWS S3 + `use_lockfile` | Secure, versioned, native S3 locking (Terraform ≥ 1.10) |
| State region | `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney) | Aligns with client's AWS region |
| Environment strategy | Single account, env-prefix naming | `DEV_`, `TEST_`, `PROD_` prefixes on all objects — only `DEV_` is wired up today |
| Snowflake provider | `snowflakedb/snowflake ~> 2.0` | Resolved to v2.21.0 |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Already used for source control |

## Known Limitations (demo scope)

Disclosed deliberately, not hidden — these are the honest boundaries of what this demo
build covers:

- **DEV is continuous; TEST is promoted deliberately (see [Environments & Versioning](#environments--versioning)); PROD is not built yet.**
  `terraform/env/prod/` tfvars/backend configs are scaffolded. Extending to PROD is a
  repeatable pattern (new GitHub Environment pair, new OIDC service-user pair, new DCM
  manifest target, new `promote.yml` choice) — not a redesign, the exact same steps
  already taken for TEST.
- **Masking/row-access policies are inert placeholders**
  (`dcm/sources/definitions/masking.sql`, `row_access.sql`) — pass-through/allow-all,
  pending client-confirmed PII/RLS rules.
- **No human-identity path.** Every identity in this repo is a service account (OIDC
  workload identity); there's no SSO/SCIM/MFA/network-policy story modeled here.
- A legacy, currently-unused DynamoDB table (`aws_dynamodb_table.tf_lock` in
  `terraform/bootstrap/state-backend/main.tf`) is still provisioned from an earlier design
  that predates `use_lockfile`-based S3 locking. Confirmed unused by the current backend
  config — kept intentionally rather than destroyed, not a functional dependency.

## What's Next

| Item | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| RBAC | Tiered persona → functional → database/warehouse roles | ✅ Implemented (`dcm/sources/definitions/roles.sql`, `database_roles.sql`, `grants.sql`) |
| Masking / row-access policies | PII/RLS enforcement | 🟡 Scaffolded as placeholders; real rules pending client input |
| dbt integration | Repo 3 (`customer-domain-dbt`) — staging → marts | ✅ Implemented and verified end-to-end |
| Ingestion | Repo 2 (`data-ingestion-raw`) — Snowpipe S3 → RAW | ✅ Implemented and verified end-to-end |
| Domain #2+ onboarding pattern | `dcm/domains/procurement/manifest.yml` + `_validate_render.py` | 🟡 Template written and render-validated; deliberately not deployed (see "Onboarding a New Domain") |
| TEST / PROD environments | Second+ environment tier, promotion flow | ✅ TEST implemented and verified end-to-end (all 3 repos); PROD not started |
| Semantic versioning & releases | Conventional Commits + `release-please` + tagged promotion | ✅ Implemented and verified end-to-end (all 3 repos) |
| Schema migrations tooling (schemachange/Flyway) | Versioned migration history beyond DCM's own diffing | ⬜ Not started |
